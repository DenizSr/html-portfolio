<p>We all love Miyazaki. But to be honest this is my favorite. Amazingly beautiful images and a very heartwarming story.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>

<p>Jane Austen's lovely book on screen. Super romantic imo. (Be honest; how many of you cried watching this scene?)</p>
<h3>Lord of The Rings/The Fellowship of The Ring</h3>

<p>When someone says fantasy i think Tolkien. Love the book. Love the movie. Highly recommend.</p>
